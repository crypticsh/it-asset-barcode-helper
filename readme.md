# IT Asset Barcode Helper Menu Thing

## General
This script was designed to be use on a checkout computer (touch screen friendly(ish?)) with a scanner (preferably, but not required)

Below is what the menu looks like.  The operator can do one of the following:
* Barcode Scanner - Scan one of the options (Perferably the scanner should be set to Enter/Carriage Return/Line Feed after successful scan
	* Note that this will require a scanner that can scan off of computer screens (a.k.a. not a traditional Laser Scanner)
		*If you have a normal 1D Laser Scanner, you can simply take a screenshot of the menu or grab the files from /menuBarcodes, or click the below image and download it.
* Touch Screen - Touch what option you want
* Keyboard - Type in the number of the option you want, and hit enter
